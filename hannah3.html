            <p class="text">
            &emsp13; &emsp13; I made this website just for you 
            and to go back to our past, it may have been very 
            rough but I cherished every time we spent together.
            It may be some small giggles, corny jokes, the feeling
            looking at each other and laughing because we know 
            for a fact that we do love each other, it's just that
            sometimes, things get in our way. But none of it comes
            close how you loved me so much, you gave me the love that
            I don't even know I deserve. I am indebted to you so much
            and I feel so ashamed that I'm not able to grow as much as 
            you did when you tried to love me and how I hurt you sometimes.
            But none of it matters now, I'll always know that we love each
            other very much and you don't even need to prove it for me to
            know that you do. <br><br>

            I've found our pictures from back then, and I'm so proud
            with how much we've grown together and how we made each other as
            a backbone to improve. I never knew that we'll be able to grow this
            much as a person and I'm very much happy with it. I hope we're able
            to grow more and become the bestbversion of ourselves even if 
            through any mess and chaos. I wanna stay with you, I'm sorry if 
            sometimes I'm not able to show it. I love you so much and I hope
            we'll be able to love each other more.💖
